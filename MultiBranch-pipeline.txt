Multi branch pipeline Session 15th time 9:30 min  
--------------------------------------------------------
A multibranch pipeline in Jenkins is a Jenkinsfile that defines a pipeline for multiple branches of a single Git repository. 
When a change is pushed to the repository, Jenkins automatically detects the branch and runs the pipeline for that branch. 
This allows for separate build and deployment processes for different branches, such as development, staging, and production. 
Jenkins uses the Jenkinsfile to define the pipeline stages, steps, and actions for each branch.
------------------------------------------------------------
-->in every organisation there are developes create code and upload code into git. they do freaquently changing code for better results
   based on client requirement and upload into git 
-->also developers create code different branches to complete work in a uncluttered way 
	supose there is master branch in that branch 
		   	loans branch
			personal banking branch
-->some time they want to merger with master branch and run or build the job 
-->some times they need to run job at the level of loans branch and perform only two steps download and build the job
   for that we need run job in the multi branch pipeline 
-->in the multi branch pipeline provide build and run the job at the same time seperately and after code modified in the github 
   it will automatically excutes both job seperately and indivudually also 
-->if one branch code modified and upload into github then that job only excutes
--->for that we need "jenkinsfile" in the both branches regarding how many steps need to perform job need to specify separately
    but main importantly jenkinsfiles should be same in every branch then only it will build the job 
-----------------------------------------------	
some git commands at local repository 
---------------------------------------
	-->git remote add origin http://github/repository_link_provide_here --->for create link to your local repository to remote repository
	-->git push -u origin -->this command only upload master branch changes
	-->git push -u --all  -->this command upload all master and child branches  changes also 
--------------------------------------
steps:
-----------------
1.Create a remote repository in the github 
2.upload code into github all branches
3.open jenkins webpage 
4.create a new job "Multi-branch-pipeline" name-->select Multibranch pipeline
	-->select branch sources-->project repository-->(provide http://link_of the git hub where all code uploaded )
	-->automatically take jenkins file and make sure you have same name file of all branches 
	-->if you want to run you job periodically then select "Periodically" option if not otherwise run job
	-->save 
5.if code modified and upload into github automatically run job based on jenkinsfile
6.if code modified and upload code into github related to all branches it builds the job all branches
  or if code modified and upload code into github in a sigle branch it will perform only that branch
