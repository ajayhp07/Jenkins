poll scm and web hooks Jenkins9th-session
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1.poll scm works based on whenever code changes and upload into 
repository automatically job builds 
2.when we give credential into the POLL SCM 
	MINUTE HOUR DOM MONTH DOW

note:star represent repitavely
3.open job configure-->goto general-->go to build triggers-->select POLL SCM

4.Provides a cron -like feature to periodically execute this project.
This feature is primarily for using Jenkins as a cron replacement, 
and it is not ideal for continuously building software projects . 
When people first start continuous integration, they are often 
so used to the idea of regularly scheduled builds like daily/weekly 
that they use this feature. However, the point of continuous integration 
is to start a build as soon as a change is made, to provide a quick 
feedback to the change. To do that you need to hook up SCM change 
notification to Jenkins .
------------------------------------
webhooks
-----------
1.here whenever code is modified that time only intimation will send to jenkins
  to build the job that is called web hooks
2.webhooks first configure the at the level of web repository in the github
3.goto github-->open one project like "maven"-->open settings-->webhooks-->add webhook-->asking credential of github
4.here display webhook information in the playLoad URL give jenkins http://jenkins_public_ip:8080/github-webhook/
	-->content type-->select json 
	-->click on add webhook
5.Now goto Jenkins web page -->goto project -->configure-->goto general-->goto build trigger-->select Github hook trigger for GITScm polling 
	-->click on save 
6.now here my jenkins never go into check the remote repository whenever code changes in the git repository
  git will send a notification to the jenkins to build the job and based on that notification 
  jenkins trigger the CI and CD 

=================================================
Q:how wil you automate cicd in such a way that whenever developer uploading code it should automatically 
 
-----------------------
POLL SCM : poll scm works check if code modified or not every time based on specified time loop (which means every 5 min) if code is not modified it will not build if code modified then it will trigger build job 
-->diadvantage here jenkins request to github every five minuites or one minuites (specifid in the credentiol) 
-->by using pollscm jenkins uneccessarly checking to github whether code modified or not it may take system resources what ever time we specified there 

WEBHOOKS: it works like whenever code modified then only github send to notfication to jenkins then only jenkins will trigger to build the job 
-->here remote repository send notifications to jenkins whenever code modified this is better option
